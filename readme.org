* Requirements

** Consensys prototype runner (Rust)

System currently assumes that the source from
<https://github.com/status-im/consensus-prototypes> is available
locally as <file:///~/work/consensus-prototypes>.

Use the following commit:

#+caption: commit
#+begin_example
afc235c (HEAD -> main, origin/main, origin/HEAD) Force extensions for output format files (#81)
#+end_example

A rust toolchain is most comfortably installed via <https://rustup.rs/>

Building the release target will produce a binary located at 
   <file://~/work/consensus-prototypes/target/release-opt/consensus-simulations"

** gnuplot

In local users PATH

** Common Lisp

Tested under ABCL and SBCL
